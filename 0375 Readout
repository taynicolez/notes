is everyone here
1) This is from the point of an attacker that already has access to Charters intenral network
2) we use cvss calculater to score
3) in archer, the tickets will be imported with the corresponding days for remediation
4) go over days, informational is reccomended to fix not required
5) go over vulnerabilities 
    -Brief overview of vulnerability, screenshots, back to reccomendations

OTP Bypass
1) obtained valid otp response
2) logged in with vip code that gave ivalid reponse and replaced with one captured earlier
rec: -validate client side input before 

SAML authentication manipulation
1)capture saml token, change data in token to employee with higher privleges
2) no more out of band error, taken to vip screen
rec: respnses should be validated with strict manipulation protection, binding them to the original session and/or user.
    emsure saml response cannotr be reused across different sessions or devices.

weak saml encryption
1) capture token and view it is easily decrypted
rec: SAML responses should be encrypted, we recommend using an encryption algorithm, it is best practice to use SHA-384, SHA3384, SHA-512 or SHA3-512, instead of base64 and/or adding hashing on top of the base64 to prevent data exposure.

Username enumeration
1) brute force the usernames including valid pids, observe response time differnces.
rec: ensure uniform response times 

verbose error messages
1) navigate to a fake extension and view verbose error message including serverlet information
rec) implement errror handling to return generic error messaging

Arbitray Json 
1) insert arbitrary input in the request and see it is a 200 reponse
rec: It is generally considered best practice to sanitize JSON inputs and return an error message such as 404 or 400 if the JSON is unexpected, even if the arbitrary JSON is not accepted on the server side.
